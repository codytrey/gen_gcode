A simple g-code generator writen in rust.

## What is gen_gcode?

gen_gcode is a (very) simple rust library for generating g-code, with a focus on 3d printing. Checked out the [2wallbox](./examples/2wallbox.rs) for more details on how to use gen_gcode.

## Why gen_gcode?

I couldn't sleep one night and noticed that there are multiple stl parsing crates, and even a g-code parsing crate. But I having seen a g-code generating one. I decided that this would finally be the motivation I need to really learn Rust, and maybe someone else will find it useful.
